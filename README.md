# Android-Weather-Application

This is a full working application that can be installed on any Android device running Android KitKat(4.4)

This app takes the user's location (with their permission) and sends the data to Openweather which returns the current 
weather to the device. The device then takes this data and outputs the correct image (cloudy or rainy) to the user.
